### Setting up your Azure environment

An Azure Service Principal is needed for populating the controller manifests. This utilizes [environment-based authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/go/azure/azure-sdk-go-authorization#use-environment-based-authentication).

  1. List your Azure subscriptions.

   ```bash
  az account list -o table
   ```

  2. Save your Subscription ID in an environment variable.

  ```bash
  export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<SubscriptionId>"
  ```

  3. Create an Azure Service Principal by running the following command or skip this step and use a previously created Azure Service Principal.

  ```bash
  az ad sp create-for-rbac --name SPClusterAPI --role owner
  ```

  4. Save the output from the above command in environment variables.

  ```bash
  export AZURE_TENANT_ID="<Tenant>"
  export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<AppId>"
  export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET='<Password>'
  export AZURE_LOCATION="eastus" # this should be an Azure region that your subscription has quota for.
  ```

:warning: NOTE: If your password contains single quotes (`'`), make sure to escape them. To escape a single quote, close the quoting before it, insert the single quote, and re-open the quoting.
For example, if your password is `foo'blah$`, you should do `export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET='foo'\''blah$'`.

  5. Set the name of the AzureCloud to be used, the default value that would be used by most users is "AzurePublicCloud", other values are:

 - ChinaCloud: "AzureChinaCloud"
 - GermanCloud: "AzureGermanCloud"
 - PublicCloud: "AzurePublicCloud"
 - USGovernmentCloud: "AzureUSGovernmentCloud"

```bash
export AZURE_ENVIRONMENT="AzurePublicCloud"
```

<!--An alternative is to install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) and have the project's script create the service principal automatically. _Note that the service principals created by the scripts will not be deleted automatically._ -->

### Using images

By default, images offered by "capi" in the Azure Marketplace are used. You can list these *reference images* with this command:

```bash
az vm image list --publisher cncf-upstream --offer capi --all -o table
```

For more control over your nodes, you can use a [*custom image*][custom-images].

## Troubleshooting

Please refer to the [troubleshooting guide][troubleshooting].
